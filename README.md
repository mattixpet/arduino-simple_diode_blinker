# arduino-simple_diode_blinker

## Usage:
* Hook the code up on yo arduino!
* Have as many digital outputs as leds as you want (right now it's 8, simple code change). Don't forget some resistor!
* Connect push buttons to analog inputs 0-4. Keep 5 unconnected. Make sure those inputs receive >880 mV (i assume mV) when button is pressed (again simple code changable value).
* Have fun!

## Info:
* Look at a sample video, **ljósasjó.mp4**.
* The analog input buttons work as follows:
  * s0 - regular blink
  * s1 - alternating blink
  * s2 - random blink
  * s3 - in-a-row blink
  * s4 - reset
